abstract="This paper analyzes the connection between the Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm and proposes two novel methods, PBSv2 and PAA, to enhance the performance of the PSO algorithm and its variants. PBSv2 modifies the approximation of the Derivative component of a previous work PBS and enables better diversity. Also, the PAA method fully exploits the PID concept and introduces two adjustable parameters {\$}{\$}(k{\_}{\{}i{\}}, k{\_}{\{}d{\}}){\$}{\$}(ki,kd)to balance searching ability and convergence speed. Compared with the original PSO variants and PBS enhanced ones, the PSO variants assisted by the two newly proposed approaches can achieve better optimization accuracy. This is demonstrated by applying our method to the CEC2014 Benchmark Suite. The result of these numerical experiments, which are included, shows that the PAA method can significantly accelerate the convergence speed of the optimization process. Application of this approach to other problems merit study.",
